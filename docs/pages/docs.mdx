title: Quickstart
---

Documentation is hard. Without structure over time it turns into a random collection of articles.

## Getting Started

Getting started guides are self contained articles and should get a user going
following the shortest path.
They are for beginners, people who may have never heard about Teleport before.
A good quickstart takes 5-10 minutes, starts with benefits and a demo video.

For example, an article can start with "SSO and Audit for Kubernetes in 3 steps".
Then it follows with a demo video. Prerequisites and tools used should
go next. Two-three sub-sections with the setup. Wrap up with "Next steps" section.

Getting started guides should try hard to keep a busy user engaged. It calls out each step and where the user
is in the sequence, for example "Step 1 out of 3. Adding a local user."

<Admonition type="note">
  "Getting started" is a better term than "Quickstart".
  Google "Getting started with React" vs "React quickstart"
  and compare the search results.

## Guides

Guides are self-contained articles for intermediate-level readers setting up Teleport
for a specific scenario.
For example, "Kubernetes Access on GKE" features high availability setup,
using Firebase and GCS backend.

It's OK to have duplicate content between different guides. Readers should be able to
scroll down a single guide and get to a result without leaving the page.
Guides start with a purpose, followed by prerequisites, setup steps and next steps.

### Integrations

Integration guides explain how to set up Teleport with other tools,
for example "Access Workflows with Slack".

### Best Practices

Best practices guides are about best deployment and usage practices.
They sometimes take the form of patterns and anti-patterns.

### Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting guides list common failures and how to diagnose them,
they explain logs, remedies and tips and tricks.

## Architecture

Architecture explains how Teleport works to advanced readers.
It is often an architect, devsecops or other professional reading these guides
to make a decision on whether and how to use Teleport.

### Networking

Readers are interested to learn about ports, components and protocols used.

### Security

This section lists security protocols and primitives.
Secops look for an attack vector tree diagram.

### Deployment

Deployment diagram should explain components and how they interact with databases
and each other.

## Reference manuals

Reference manuals provide an exhaustive list of configuration options
and API methods.

A good reference manual is search friendly and lists all content on the same page.
