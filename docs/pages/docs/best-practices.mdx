## Content

**Keep it simple**

Read the book [On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548).

**Write for the target audience**

Do not overload getting started guides with content and complex terminology, focus
on benefits to the user. Do not add architecture diagrams in getting started guides.
Likewise, do not do demos in architecture articles.

**Keep guides self-contained**

All guides should have everything that is needed for a reader
to accomplish their goal. This sometimes leads to duplication.
Use include directives for repeated content. Remove backslash before the exclamation marks for it to work:

```bash
{% raw %}{{\!CHANGELOG.md\!}}{% endraw %}
```

## Diagrams

Use [Teleport's lucidchart library](https://app.lucidchart.com/lucidchart/dfcf1f4a-5cf0-4758-8ebb-f6ea86900aba/edit)
to create diagrams with a consistent design language.

## Videos

Mac users should use Quicktime's `Cmd-Shift-5` to record a small part of the screen:

![quicktime](../../img/docs/quicktime.webp)

**Convert Mov to MP4 and WebM**

Quicktime outputs large `.mov` files. Use `ffmpeg` to convert them into `mp4` and `webm`
web-friendly formats:

```bash
# create MP4
ffmpeg -i input.mov -b:v 0 -crf 25 output.mp4
# create WebM
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 output.webm
```

**Embed videos**

```html
<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.webm" type="video/webm" />
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

To test videos locally, add them to the `../img/video` folder of the docs.
For production, upload to the website and refer from there:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/teleport/videos/database-access-preview/dbaccessdemo.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
