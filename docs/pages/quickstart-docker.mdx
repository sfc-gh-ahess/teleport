h1: Run Teleport using Docker

We provide pre-built Docker images for every version of Teleport. These images are hosted on quay.io.

- [All tags under `quay.io/gravitational/teleport` are Teleport Community images](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tag=latest&tab=tags)

We currently only offer Docker images for `x86_64` architectures.

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
  This setup will not let you 'SSH into' the node that is running Teleport without additional configuration.
</Admonition>

## Pick your image

This table gives an idea of how our image naming scheme works. We offer images which
point to a static version of Teleport, as well as images which are automatically rebuilt
every night. These nightly images point to the latest version of Teleport from the
three most recent release branches. They are stable, and we recommend their use to
easily keep your Teleport installation up to date.

| Image name | Teleport version | Image automatically updated? | Image base |
| - | - | - | - |
| `quay.io/gravitational/teleport:{{ version }}` | The latest version of Teleport Community {{ version }} | Yes | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) |
| `quay.io/gravitational/teleport:{{ teleport.version }}` | The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. {{ teleport.version }}) | No | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) |

For testing, we always recommend that you use the latest release version of Teleport, which is currently `{{teleport.latest_oss_docker_image}}`.

## Quickstart using docker-compose

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

The easiest way to start Teleport quickly is to use `docker-compose` with our [`teleport-quickstart.yml`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/docker/teleport-quickstart.yml) file:

```bash
# download the quickstart file from our Github repo
curl -Lso teleport-quickstart.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/master/docker/teleport-quickstart.yml

# start teleport quickstart using docker-compose
docker-compose -f teleport-quickstart.yml up
```

- The `docker-compose` quickstart will automatically create a config file for you at `./docker/teleport/config/teleport.yaml`
- This config is mounted into the container under `/etc/teleport/teleport.yaml`
- It will also start `teleport` using this config file, with Teleport's data directory set to `./docker/teleport/data` and mounted under `/var/lib/teleport`
- By default, `docker-compose` will output Teleport's logs to the console for you to observe.
  - If you would rather run the Teleport container in the background, use `docker-compose -f teleport-quickstart.yml up -d`
  - You can stop the Teleport container using `docker-compose -f teleport-quickstart.yml down`

## Quickstart using docker run

If you'd prefer to complete these steps manually, here's some sample `docker run` commands:

```bash
# create local config and data directories for teleport, which will be mounted into the container
mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data

# generate a sample teleport config and write it to the local config directory
# this container will write the config and immediately exit - this is expected
docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/bin/sh \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  {{teleport.latest_oss_docker_image}} -c "teleport configure > /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml"

# start teleport with mounted config and data directories, plus all ports
docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3023:3023 -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  {{teleport.latest_oss_docker_image}}
```

## Creating a Teleport user when using Docker quickstart

To create a user inside your Teleport container, use `docker exec`.

This example command will create a Teleport user called `testuser` which is allowed to log in as either OS user `root` or `ubuntu`. Feel free to change these to suit your needs -
[there are more instructions above in Step 3](getting-started.mdx) if you'd like additional details):

```bash
docker exec teleport tctl users add testuser root,ubuntu
```

When you run this command, Teleport will output a URL which you must open to complete the user signup process:

```bash
User testuser has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h0m0s:
https://localhost:3080/web/invite/4f2718a52ce107568b191f222ba069f7

NOTE: Make sure localhost:3080 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

You can now [follow this guide from Step 4 onwards](getting-started.mdx) to
create your user and log into Teleport.
