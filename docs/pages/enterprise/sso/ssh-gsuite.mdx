## Google Apps as SSO for SSH

This guide will cover how to configure [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com) to be a
single sign-on (SSO) provider to issue SSH credentials to specific groups of users.
When used in combination with role based access control (RBAC) it allows SSH administrators
to define policies like:

- Only members of "DBA" Google group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.
- ... and many others.

  This guide requires an enterprise version of Teleport 4.1.4 or greater. The open source
  edition of Teleport only supports [Github](../../admin-guide.mdx#github-oauth-20) as
  an SSO provider.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started you’ll need:

- An Enterprise version of Teleport v4.1.4 or greater, downloaded from [https://dashboard.gravitational.com/](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login).
- Be a G Suite Super Admin. As Google Best Practices, we would recommend setting up a seperate super admin with 2FA vs using your user.
  - e.g. A dedicated account [ben-ops@practice.io](mailto:ben-ops@practice.io) vs my daily [ben@practice.io](mailto:ben@practice.io)
- Ability to create GCP Project.
  - This might require signing up to GCP, but for this project it won’t require using any paid services. It’s just a side effect of G Suite and GCP being closely related.
- Have a [verified Domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60216?hl=en).
- Ability to Setup G Suite Groups

## Configure G Suite

1. Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials  [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)

2. Create a new Project.
   ![Create New Project](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-1-new-project.png)

3. Select OAuth client ID.
   ![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-2-created-creds.png)

4. Make Application Type Public & Setup Domain Verification
   ![Setup Application Type](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-3-oauth.png)

5. Copy OAuth Client ID and Client Secret for YAML Below.
   Note: The redirect_url: `https://teleport.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/oidc/callback`

![Copy Client Secret](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5-copy-client-id.png)

## Create a Service Account

![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5a-service-account.png)
Leave Service account users roles, and admin roles as blank.
![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5b-service-account.png)
Leave Service account permissions as blank.
![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5c-service-account.png)

### Enable Account Delegation

![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5d-service-account-delegation.png)
![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5e-enable-delegation.png)

### Download Service Account JSON

![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5f-download-json.png)

This JSON file will need to be uploaded to the Authentication server, and will be later referenced by
the OIDC Connector, under `google_service_account_uri`.

<Admonition type="note">
  Teleport requires the service account JSON to be uploaded to all Teleport authentication servers when setting
  up in a HA config.
</Admonition>

## Manage API Scopes

Before setting the Manage API client access capture the client ID of the service account.

Within GSuite to access the Manage API client access go to Security -> Settings.  Navigate to Advanced Settings and open Manage API client access.  Put the client ID in the Client Name field and the below permissions in the API scopes as a single comma separated line.  Press Authorize.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Warning"
>
  Do not use the email of the service account. The configuration display will look the same but the service account will not have the domain-wide delegation required. The `client_id` field must be the unique ID number captured from the admin UI. An indicator that this is misconfigured is if you see "Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested." in your log.
</Admonition>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Note"
>
  The email that you set for `google_admin_email` **must** be the email address of a user that has permission to list all groups, users, and group membership in your G Suite account. This user will generally need super admin privileges.
</Admonition>

**Client Name:** For Client Name: Use the Unique ID for the service account.  [See Video for instructions](https://youtu.be/DG97l8WJ6oU?t=281).

**API Scopes:** Copy these three API Scopes.

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
```

## Create a OIDC Connector

Now, create a OIDC connector [resource](../../admin-guide.mdx#resources).
Write down this template as `gsuite-connector.yaml`:

```yaml
{!examples/resources/gsuite-connector.yaml!}
```

Create the connector using `tctl` tool:

```bsh
$ tctl create gsuite-connector.yaml
```

## Create Teleport Roles

We are going to create 2 roles:

- Privileged role admin who is able to login as root and is capable of administrating
  the cluster
- Non-privileged dev

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: admin
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [root]
    node_labels:
      "*": "*"
    rules:
      - resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"]
```

Devs are only allowed to login to nodes labelled with `access: relaxed`
Teleport label. Developers can log in as either `ubuntu` or a username that
arrives in their assertions. Developers also do not have any rules needed to
obtain admin access to Teleport.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [ "{% raw %}{{external.username}}{% endraw %}", ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      access: relaxed
```

**Notice:** Replace `ubuntu` with linux login available on your servers!

```bsh
$ tctl create admin.yaml
$ tctl create dev.yaml
```

## Testing

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with GSuite". The CLI is
the same as before:

```bsh
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"

  Teleport can use multiple OIDC connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=gsuite`
</Admonition>

## Troubleshooting

If you get "access denied" errors the number one place to check is the audit
log on the Teleport auth server. It is located in `/var/lib/teleport/log` by
default and it will contain the detailed reason why a user's login was denied.

Example of a user being denied due as the role `clusteradmin` wasn't setup.

```json
{"code":"T1001W","error":"role clusteradmin is not found","event":"user.login","method":"oidc","success":false,"time":"2019-06-15T19:38:07Z","uid":"cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"}
```

Some errors (like filesystem permissions or misconfigured network) can be
diagnosed using Teleport's `stderr` log, which is usually available via:

```bsh
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

If you wish to increase the verbosity of Teleport's syslog, you can pass the
[`--debug`](../../cli-docs.mdx#teleport-start) flag to `teleport start` command.
