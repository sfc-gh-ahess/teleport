description: Teleport Kubernetes Access introduction, demo and resources
---

Teleport provides a unified access for Kubernetes clusters.

- Users can receive short-lived certificates using Single Sign-On and switch between clusters without relogins.
- Admins can use roles to implement policies "developers must not access production" and enforce
dual authorization using [access workflows](./enterprise/workflow/index.mdx) for privileged operations.
- Organizations can achieve compliance by capturing `kubectl` events and session recordings for `kubectl`.

## SSO and Audit for Kubernetes Clusters

Set up single sign on, capture audit events and sessions with Teleport running in a Kubernetes cluster.
