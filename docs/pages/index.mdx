## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a Unified Access Plane for your infrastructure.

- Single sign-on access plane for all your SSH servers, Kubernetes, Databases and Web Apps.
- List all environments and see which servers are online with a single CLI command or via a live view in a browser.
- Customize access workflows and integrate access into existing DevOps tools or your own applications using your favorite programming language.
- Define and enforce policy to handle idle sessions, concurrent sessions, and to share and record interactive sessions across all environments.

## Why Use Teleport

Here are some of the most popular use-cases for Teleport:

- Use short lived certificates instead of static keys for SSH, Kubernetes, Databases and Web Apps.
- Structured events and session recording/replay for `ssh` and `kubectl`.
- Centralized SSH and Kubernetes Certificate Authority.
- Setup a unified access plane for an entire organization.
- Enforce 2nd factor auth with U2F and TOTP.
- Connect to computing resources located behind firewalls or without static IPs.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through [session sharing](user-manual.mdx#sharing-sessions).
- Discover online servers and Docker containers within a cluster with [dynamic node labels](admin-guide.mdx#labeling-nodes-and-applications).
- Capture sessions and manage certificates for existing [OpenSSH fleet](openssh-teleport.mdx).
- Secure access to internal web applications and services with [application access](application-access.mdx).

## Teleport Open Source

## Teleport Enterprise

Teleport Enterprise is built around the open-source core in Teleport Open Source,
with the added benefits of role-based access control (RBAC) and easy
integration with identity managers for single sign-on (SSO).

- [Teleport Enterprise Introduction](enterprise/introduction.mdx) - Overview of the additional capabilities of Teleport Enterprise.
- [Teleport Enterprise Quick Start](enterprise/quickstart-enterprise.mdx) - A quick tutorial to show off the basic capabilities of Teleport Enterprise.
  A good place to start if you want to jump right in.
- [RBAC for SSH](enterprise/ssh-rbac.mdx) - Details on how Teleport Enterprise provides Role-based Access Controls (RBAC) for SSH.
- [SSO for SSH](enterprise/sso/ssh-sso.mdx) - Overview on how Teleport Enterprise works with external identity providers for single sign-on (SSO).

Teleport is available through the free, open source edition ("Teleport Community Edition")
or a commercial edition ("Teleport Enterprise Edition").

## Operating System Support

Teleport is officially supported on the platforms listed below. It is worth noting
that the open source community has been successful in building and running Teleport on
UNIX variants other than Linux [2].

| Operating System | Teleport Client | Teleport Server |
| - | - | - |
| Linux v2.6+ | yes | yes |
| MacOS v10.12+ | yes | yes |
| Windows [1] | yes [1] | no |

[1] *Teleport server does not run on Windows yet, but `tsh` (the Teleport client)
can be used on Windows to execute `tsh login` to retrieve a user's SSH
certificate and use it with `ssh`, the OpenSSH client, running on a Windows
client machine.*

[2] *Teleport is written in Go and it is theoretically possible to build it on
any OS supported by the [Golang toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MinimumRequirements)*.
