# RFD 12 - Teleport versioning

## What

Versioning scheme for Teleport releases (post-5.0).

### Terminology

Quick note on terminology used below. I'll use naming from
[semver](https://semver.org):

```
vX.Y.Z
 ^ ^ ^
 | | *- "patch version Z"
 | *- "minor version Y"
 *- "major version X"
```

## Why

Teleport has ~4 big releases per year.

Up to v5.0.0, Teleport used a versioning scheme that looks like semver (but
actually isn't):
- a minor version is bumped for all regular releases (e.g. 4.3 -> 4.4)
- a major version is bumped when a release _feels_ particularly significant
  (e.g. 4.4 -> 5.0 with introduction of application access)
- a patch version is bumped for bug patches

Our compatibility promise is:

> When running multiple binaries of Teleport within a cluster (nodes, proxies, clients, etc), the following rules apply:
>
> * Patch versions are always compatible, for example any 4.0.1 component will work with any 4.0.3 component.
> * Other versions are always compatible with their previous release. This means you must not attempt to upgrade from 4.1 straight to 4.3. You must upgrade to 4.2 first.
> * Teleport clients tsh for users and tctl for admins may not be compatible with different versions of the teleport service.

The 2nd point is crucial: we **never** break compatibility with a previous
release (be it a major or a minor version bump).

The downsides of this versioning scheme are:
- the distinction between major and minor version bumps is largely driven by
  business/product and has no technical difference
- a user that doesn't read our upgrade docs carefully can assume semver
  semantics:
  - upgrading from `vX.A.B` to `vX.C.D` is safe - it's not if `C - A > 1`
  - upgrading from `vX.A.B` to `vY.C.D` is going to break things - it won't, as
    long as these are sequential releases

Therefore, I propose to switch to a more semver-like scheme, starting with 6.0.

## Details

- Major versions are for teleport releases.
- Minor versions are for backwards-compatible features and improvements, and
  non-critical bugfix batches
- Patch versions are for quick followup regression and critical bug fixes.
- Suffixes:
  - `-dev` suffix is for development builds (e.g. off of the `main` branch)
  - `-alpha.X` suffix, built from `main` branch, good for demos and early
    deploys, but not staging
  - `-beta.X` suffix, built from `main` branch, good for staging deploys, but
    not production
  - `-rc.X` suffixes are for release candidates, potentially production-ready
    but still in testing, built from `branch/vN`

The benefits are:
- Major version bumps clearly communicate to users to exercise caution when
  upgrading, and read release notes
- Minor/patch version bumps are a no-brainer and can be automated
- Users can intuitively understand versioning semantics, due to popularity of
  semver

### Compatibility

`vN.*.*` binaries are compatible with any other `vN.*.*` or `vN-1.*.*` binaries
(both client and server).

Users are free to use any `vN.*.*` versions throughout their deployment, after
upgrading everything from `vN-1.*.*`.

### Support window

Teleport officially supports the latest major version and two previous major
versions. For example:
- `v8.*.*` (latest)
- `v7.*.*`
- `v6.*.*`

### Git branches

Teleport has several branches related to releases:
- `main` - main development branch
- `branch/vX` - for upcoming minor releases
  - created when `vX.0.0-rc.1` is cut
- `branch/vX.Y` - for patch releases
  - created when `vX.Y.0` is cut

Here are how different kinds of changes made map to those branches:
- work towards the next major release
  - merged into `main`
- work towards the next minor release
  - merged into `main`
  - backported into `branch/vX`
- bugfixes that need to be backported
  - merged into `main`
  - backported into `branch/vX`
  - backported into the latest `branch/vX.Y`
  - repeat for all `vX` that need the backport
- bugfixes that _do not_ need to be backported
  - merged into `main`

### Example: new release

The current release of teleport is `v5` and the next will be `v6`.

- initially, builds from `main` will be `v6.0.0-dev`
- when most big changes are merged, we cut `v6.0.0-alpha.1`
- when only small bugfix changes are pending, we cut `v6.0.0-beta.1`
- all planned changes are merged, we make `branch/v6` and cut `v6.0.0-rc.1`
- during release testing, we fix bugs and cut `v6.0.0-rc.2`, `v6.0.0-rc.3`, etc
- assuming `v6.0.0-rc.3` passes the tests, create branch `branch/v6.0` and tag
  it as `v6.0.0`
- we discover a serious bug in `v6.0.0`, fix it in `main`, `branch/v6`,
  `branch/v6.0` and cut `v6.0.1` from `branch/v6.0`
- over the next few days/weeks, we gather user feedback
- based on feedback, we fix a number of bugs in `main`, backport them to
  `branch/v6`, create branch `branch/v6.1` and cut `v6.1.0` from it

### Example: backports

The latest 3 released versions are `v8.0.1`, `v7.1.2`, `v6.3.2`.

- we discover a bug affecting all versions
- we fix it in `main`
- if the bug is urgent, we backport to `branch/v8`, `branch/v8.0`, `branch/v7`,
  `branch/v7.1`, `branch/v6`, `branch/v6.3` and release `v8.0.2`, `v7.1.3`,
  `v6.3.3`
- if the bug is not urgent and no customer has requested backports to older
  versions, we backport to `branch/v8`, create `branch/v8.1` and release
  `v8.1.0`
  - optionally, we wait for more bug fixes to accumulate in `branch/v8` before
    releasing `v8.1.0`

### Example: security vulnerability

The latest 3 released versions are `v8.0.1`, `v7.1.2`, `v6.3.2`.

- we discover a security bug affecting all versions
- we fix it in `main` and backport to `branch/v8`, `branch/v8.0`,
  `branch/v7`, `branch/v7.1`, `branch/v6`, `branch/v6.3`
- after backports merge, we release `v8.0.2`, `v7.1.3`, `v6.3.3`

### Why not use minor versions, like we do now?

An experienced reader might notice that this is not exactly semver. In semver,
major versions are for strictly breaking changes with no compatibility.

So why not keep using minor version bumps like we do now? And reserve major
version for when we really need to make a breaking change?

Because we want to keep our compatibility guarantee and avoid the Python 2/3
story. We never want a `vN+1` that has no migration path other than "rebuild
the cluster from scratch".

So we don't want to freeze the major version forever this way.

### Docker image tags

Currently, we have 2 kinds of docker images:

- `teleport:X.Y.Z` - immutable tag for a specific patch release (for example
  `4.4.1`, `4.4.2`)
- `teleport:X.Y` - mutable tag pointing at the latest patch release for `X.Y` (for
  example `4.4` pointing at `4.4.2`)

For new versioning, the following tags are created:

- `teleport:X.Y.Z` - immutable tag for a specific patch release (for example
  `5.1.0`, `5.1.1`)
- `teleport:X` - mutable tag pointing at the latest patch release for major
  version `X` (for example `5` pointing at `5.1.1`)

In the above example, if we cut `v5.2.0`, the following tag changes happen:

- new tag `5.2.0`
- existing tag `5` updated to point at `5.2.0`

The old `teleport:X.Y` tags will no longer be generated, since they are an
inferior version of `teleport:X` and shouldn't be used. This may cause customer
confusion and some support load during the transition, but it's less work than
maintaining the `teleport:X.Y` tag.
